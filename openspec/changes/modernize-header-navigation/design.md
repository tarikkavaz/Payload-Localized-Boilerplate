## Context

The current header navigation uses a basic Select dropdown approach which lacks the sophistication and user experience of modern web applications. The Tailwind UI sample demonstrates best practices with HeadlessUI components, but we need to adapt this pattern to our existing tech stack (Radix UI + Lucide icons) while maintaining compatibility with our Payload CMS navigation structure.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Modern, professional navigation UI matching current design trends
- Seamless dark/light theme integration
- Excellent accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain existing CMS navigation data structure compatibility

**Non-Goals:**
- Changing the underlying CMS navigation configuration
- Adding new navigation features (breadcrumbs, mega menus, etc.)
- Modifying the header layout significantly
- Performance optimization (current performance is acceptable)

## Decisions

**UI Library Choice**: Use Radix UI Popover instead of HeadlessUI
- **Why**: Already integrated in project, consistent with existing components
- **Alternative considered**: Adding HeadlessUI dependency - rejected due to library consistency

**Mobile Pattern**: Dialog-based slide-out instead of full-screen overlay
- **Why**: Better UX on larger mobile screens, matches modern app patterns
- **Alternative considered**: Full-screen overlay - rejected as less sophisticated

**Animation Strategy**: CSS transitions with Radix UI built-in animations
- **Why**: Lightweight, performant, consistent with existing component animations
- **Alternative considered**: Framer Motion - overkill for this use case

**Icon Strategy**: Lucide React icons to replace Heroicons
- **Why**: Already in use throughout the project
- **Alternative considered**: Adding Heroicons - unnecessary dependency

## Risks / Trade-offs

**Risk**: More complex component structure → **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and clear code organization
**Risk**: Potential accessibility regressions → **Mitigation**: Comprehensive accessibility testing
**Risk**: Mobile interaction issues → **Mitigation**: Extensive mobile device testing

**Trade-off**: Increased bundle size vs better UX - accepting slight size increase for significantly better user experience

## Migration Plan

1. **Development**: Implement new navigation alongside existing (feature flag if needed)
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive cross-device and accessibility testing
3. **Deployment**: Direct replacement (no gradual rollout needed for UI change)
4. **Rollback**: Keep backup of current implementation until deployment is verified

## Open Questions

- Should we add any new navigation features while modernizing?
- Do we need to support any legacy browser compatibility requirements?
- Are there any specific accessibility requirements beyond WCAG 2.1 AA?
